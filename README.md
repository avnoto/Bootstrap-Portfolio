# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Homework #2  -- Bootstrap Portfolio

My personal portfolio webpage created using HTML, CSS, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

After I commited it, I noticed an error in my code- there was a extra spacing with the a tags for my social media links. I fixed this issue but didn't want to push my changes past the deadline. 

*Update* 

Pushed changes: -spacing of a tags for social media icons
                -added hr tags for thematic breaks between container titles and their paragraphs
                -fixed Contact Form; user can now enter their name in the 'name' line rather than email. Email is on second line.
