# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Homework #2  -- Bootstrap Portfolio

My personal portfolio webpage created using HTML, CSS, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

After I commited it, I noticed an error in my code- there was a extra spacing with the a tags for my social media links. I fixed this issue but didn't want to push my changes past the deadline.
